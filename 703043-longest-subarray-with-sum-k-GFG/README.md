# [Longest Subarray with Sum K](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-sub-array-with-sum-k0809/1)
## Medium
Given an array arr[] containing integers and an integer k, your task is to find the length of the longest subarray where the sum of its elements is equal to the given value&nbsp;k. If there is no subarray with sum equal to&nbsp;k, return 0.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 2, 7, 1, -10], k = 15
Output: 6
Explanation: Subarrays with sum = 15 are [5, 2, 7, 1], [10, 5] and [10, 5, 2, 7, 1, -10]. The length of the longest subarray with a sum of 15 is 6.
Input: arr[] = [-5, 8, -14, 2, 4, 12], k = -5
Output: 5
Explanation: Subarrays with sum = -5 are [-5] and [-5, 8, -14, 2, 4]. The length of the longest subarray with a sum of -5 is 5.
Input: arr[] = [10, -10, 20, 30], k = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: No subarray with sum = 5 is present in arr[].
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105-104&nbsp;≤ arr[i] ≤ 104-109 ≤ k ≤ 109
